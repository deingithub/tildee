Tildee â€” A Tildes Client Library
================================

This is Tildee, a Python 3 library for interacting with the https://tildes.net API. Note that this API is not stable and not actually intended for external use, so this could break at any moment.

`Source code <https://git.dingenskirchen.systems/Dingens/tildee.py>`_ and `issue tracker <https://git.dingenskirchen.systems/Dingens/tildee.py/issues>`_ on Dingenskirchen Systems Git.
Available on `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/tildee/>`_.

Capabilities
------------

Currently Tildee can parse posts and their comments, create comments, topics and messages, parse new messages and notifications, edit comment and topic contents, edit topic metadata, delete, remove and lock topics and comments.

Missing features
----------------

See the `relevant label on the issue tracker <https://git.dingenskirchen.systems/Dingens/tildee.py/issues?labels=15>`_.

Development
-----------

To install dependencies, run ``poetry install``. You can run a python shell in the environment using ``poetry run python`` (I'd recommend using ``ipython``, too). Format your code before committing by running ``black .``.
